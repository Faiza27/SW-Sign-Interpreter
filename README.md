**Sign language is a visual language that is used by deaf people as their mother tongue. Unlike acoustically conveyed sound patterns, sign language uses body language and manual communication to fluidly convey the thoughts of a person. Due to considerable time required in learning Sign Language,  it becomes difficult to communicate with these specially abled people, and thus creates a communication gap.**

## Objective
**This Sign Language interpreter aims at :**
- Providing information access and services to deaf people in American sign language.
- Developing a scalable project which can be extended to capture whole vocabulary of ASL through manual and non-manual signs
- Dictionary for learning sign language alphabets and sentences as well
- Makes conversation easier between speech-impaired people and normal people as it includes audio , recorded input-output feature also 

It can be developed as a desktop or mobile application to enable specially abled people to communicate easily and effectively with others

**Sign language refers to a language that employs signs made with  the hands and other movements , including facial expressions and posture of the body used primarily by the people who are deaf. People who are hearing and speech impaired are left behind in video consultations . So they face the problem of communication everywhere they go such as - conferences , meetings , health consultations , institutions even with family members . So as speech and hearing impaired normal people also face the same problem communicating with them . Sign Language is not universal . There are over 135 sign languages around the world including American Sign Language (ASL) , British Sign Language (BSL) , Australian Sign Language (Auslan) , Indian Sign Language(ISL) . Most countries that share a spoken language do not share the same sign language . Most countries that share a spoken language do not share the same sign language .
There are a few intellectual and physical disabilities where research has shown that sign language can be beneficial in communication.These include; Autism, Apraxia of speech, Cerebral Palsy, and Down Syndrome.**
